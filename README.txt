# Apostol Calculus \'96 An Applied and Visual Study Notebook\
\
This repository is intended as an applied and computational companion to Tom M. Apostol\'92s books \'93Calculus, Volume 1\'94 and \'93Calculus, Volume 2\'94. The aim is to study the topics and exercises of these books in a practical way using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This project was started by Muhammed \uc0\u304 kbal Y\u305 lmaz on January 15, 2026. As the work progresses, the contents of the repository will be updated regularly with new chapters, new solved exercises, and new visualizations.The main purpose of this project is to provide a working environment in which students studying calculus can examine abstract concepts not only on paper, but also experimentally on a computer, test them numerically, and understand them through visualizations. In this sense, although this repository is the product of a personal learning process, it is also intended to serve as an open study notebook that may be useful to others working on calculus. Apostol\'92s books are well known for their axiomatic and proof-oriented structure. The purpose of this project is not to copy the definitions, theorems, or text from the books, but to reconstruct and support the ideas using numerical experiments, symbolic computations, and graphics. For this reason, the text of the books is not included in this repository; only references to chapter and exercise numbers are used.\
\
The general structure of the repository is as follows:\
\
- The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for each chapter.\
- The `src/` directory contains reusable helper functions and numerical methods.\
- The `tests/` directory contains automated tests that check the correctness of the computations.\
- Additional directories for documentation may be added over time.\
\
This project mainly uses Python and the following libraries: NumPy, SymPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Lab, and PyTest. In later stages, additional tools may be included to enrich the visualizations.\
\
This repository is based on the following books by Tom M. Apostol:\
\
Tom M. Apostol, Calculus, Volume 1 & Volume 2, Second Edition  \
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, New York  \
Consulting Editor: George Springer  \
Year: 1967  \
ISBN: 0-471-00005-1  \
Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 67-14605  \
Printed in USA  \
\
Publisher\'92s official page:  \
https://www.wiley.com/en-kr/Calculus%2C+Volume+1%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119496731\
\
This project is not intended to replace the books. Its purpose is to provide a complementary working environment for those studying with these texts.\
\
This is a living project. Over time, its scope will expand, its content will deepen, and the methods used in it will continue to improve.\
